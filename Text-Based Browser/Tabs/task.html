<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Let's make our browser store web pages in a file and show them if the user types a shortened request (for example, wikipedia instead of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikipedia.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">wikipedia.org</a>). You can store each page as a separate file or find another way to do this. But your program should accept one command line argument which is a directory to store the files, and your web pages should be saved inside this directory.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>At this stage, your program should: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Check if the user has entered a valid URL. It must contain at least one dot, for example, <code class="java">bloomberg.com</code>. If the URL is incorrect, the browser should output an error message (it should contain the word <code class="java">error</code>) and wait for another URL.</li>
	<li>Accept a command-line argument which is a directory for saved tabs. For example, if the argument is <code class="java">dir</code>, then you need to create a folder with the name <code class="java">dir</code> and save all web pages that the user downloads in this folder.</li>
	<li>Save this web page in a file. After that, the user needs to have a simple way to see the saved web page by typing "bloomberg". The rule is simple: you just need to remove the last dot and everything that comes after it. <code class="java">bloomberg.com</code> becomes <code class="java">bloomberg</code>, <code class="java">en.wikipedia.org</code> becomes <code class="java">en.wikipedia</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Check out a tutorial to learn how to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techbeamers.com/read-write-file-in-python/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">work with files</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://thispointer.com/how-to-create-a-directory-in-python/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">create folders</a> in Python.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

The Space Race: From Apollo 11 to Elon Musk

It's 50 years since the world was gripped by historic images
of Apollo 11, and Neil Armstrong -- the first man to walk
on the moon. It was the height of the Cold War, and the charts
were filled with David Bowie's Space Oddity, and Creedence's
Bad Moon Rising. The world is a very different place than
it was 5 decades ago. But how has the space race changed since
the summer of '69? (Source: Bloomberg)
