<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Every browser has a “back” button. If the user presses this button, the browser shows the previous web page. This feature can be realized using a stack. You save the pages visited by the user: google, wikipedia, bloomberg, ..., but when the user types <code class="java">back</code>, you will see the pages in the reverse order: ..., bloomberg, wikipedia, google. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>The result of this task is the same as in the previous task, but now the program has a new feature:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The program should show the previous page if the user types <code class="java">back</code>. You can implement a stack to do this.</li>
	<li>If there are no more pages in the browser history, just don’t output anything.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

Bad Moon Rising. The world is a very different place than
it was 5 decades ago. But how has the space race changed since
the summer of '69? (Source: Bloomberg)
